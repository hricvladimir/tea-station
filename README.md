# Tea Station WebPage

The desing is from a course I took, but the coding is done by me

Just for fun I added Java Spring backend that saves a form response to Postgres DB using JPA.
However, in the live site it is just a third-party form submission handler, because I did not host my backend :)
If you are bored, you can test my form and submit someting, and I will make sure to respond to you!
